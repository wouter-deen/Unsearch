## Private and secure search engine built with Next.js

A performant (meta) search engine built with Next.js provided by Unsea. Use it to securely browse the web and get search results from multiple search engines at once!


## Usage

Feel free to clone the repo to your local machine and test it, or maybe just deploy it straight away through Docker on your server. As long as you give credit to me in an appropriate spot (e.g. the footer), I'm okay with it!

## Demo

See search.unsea.nl for a demo. Please only use this for demonstration purposes, as API access costs me money. Misuse will result in me directly terminating the demo site. I will maybe use the currently present but non-optimal scraper from cdrake in the dependencies folder, once I find time to optimise that algorithm.
