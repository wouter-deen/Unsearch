## Private and secure search engine built with Next.js

A performant (meta) search engine built with Next.js provided by Unsea. Use it to securely browse the web and get search results from multiple search engines at once!


## Usage

Feel free to clone the repo to your local machine and test it, or maybe just deploy it straight away through Docker on your server. As long as you give credit to me in an appropriate spot (e.g. the footer), I'm okay with it!
